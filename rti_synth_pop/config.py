# FOR THE USER: Currently you can configure the year and states you would like to run
# the synthetic population here. There are two requirements demonstrated below:
#   1)  a list of tuples, containing the 2 character state abbreciate and 2 digit state
#       FIPS/GEOID
#   2)  a 4 digit year. We have tested this code to run years 2019 - 2021. Assuming no
#       no PUMS/ACS changes, it should work for all years that have the same format
#       of those data.
